# Jakarta EE Mutable Infrastructure

This specification wants to give a continuous integration protocol where some
[Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/) designers and programmers are responsible of
application building only, and nobody is worried about maintaining any execution
infrastructure. Its reference implementation tries to show how can it be done.

One of the most important points is that the deployment unit comes back to be an
artifact, which can be an EAR, WAR, RAR, JAR and so on. Infrastructure layer
ends at application container level. On other words, even a cloud based
infrastructure, a new software component version does not require a new machine
instance but a new artifact deployment on an existing managed infrastructure.
